    I am a professor at Cornell University. My research focuses on
    algorithms and networks, the roles they play in large-scale social and information systems, and their broader societal implications. My work has been supported by an NSF Career Award, an ONR Young Investigator Award, a
    <strong><a href="#">MacArthur Foundation Fellowship</a></strong>, a <a href="#">Packard Foundation Fellowship</a>, a <a href="#">Simons Investigator Award</a>, a <a href="#">Sloan Foundation Fellowship</a>, a <a href="#">Vannevar Bush Faculty
      Fellowship</a>, and grants from Facebook, Google, Yahoo, the MacArthur Foundation, the ARO, and the
    NSF. I am a member of the <a href="#">National Academy of Sciences</a>, the <a href="#">National Academy of Engineering</a>, and the <a href="#">American Academy of Arts and Sciences</a>.
